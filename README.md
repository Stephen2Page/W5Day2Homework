Improve a Website with MVC

www.thebrewkettle.com
www.buckeyebeerengine.com

Both of these websites provide a listing of their beers that are on draft. Currently they provide limited information on their website though they do provide a click through to another website taphunter.com for more description. This however is disconcerting in visual appearance and does not allow easy navigation back to the listings.

They would improve by pulling the data from the other website or an there own database and providing a view that maintains integration with their website and branding. Also by tying in with customer's preferences they could provide notifications to them about what is new on draft for them.

The draft list on their website could could click through to a custom display of the beer and pull in related ones. Also by providing filtering and sorting on the different parameters (style, brewery, ABV or IBU) it would enhance the user experience.

The database or model is being hosted by a third party but is presented in a standard form that can be accessed for the custom view. .
